# Detecting Fake Reviews with Isolation Forest

In this project, I use isolation forest to detect fake reviews.
We have a dataset with reviews from a website that sells coffee tables.
I explore and preprocess the data using various statistical tools.
Based on my exploration, I decide that the best approach to detect fake reviews is to develop a hybrid system.
This system would combine a rule-based algorithm, an isolation forest model, and a K-means clustering model.
I train two isolation forest models and evaluate and interpret their results.
